# YOLOUdacityDatasetObjDetSFLombard
Implement YOLO to detect objects like cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights.  Similar to Chris Gundling's yolo light github repository.
I modify it to include traffic light color classification and add another weight file for pedestrian detection for detecting pedestrians
closer to the ego car.
